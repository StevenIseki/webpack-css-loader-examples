Basic React Example
=====================

This example is to show off basic use of css-loader as documented in the [webpack docs](https://christianalfoni.github.io/react-webpack-cookbook/Loading-CSS.html).

Note that this does not cover css-modules, it is simple for adding css imports to your react components. I prefer to use this setup and stick to [BEM](https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/) for naming convention.
